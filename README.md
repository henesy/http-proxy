# http-proxy for 9front

Fork of https://github.com/getlantern/http-proxy tweaked to run on 9front.

# Building

`go get bitbucket.org/henesy/http-proxy`

`go install bitbucket.org/henesy/http-proxy/http-proxy` 

# Running

The resulting http-proxy binary defaults to listening on :8080 and should function with both http and https.
